# 🚀 AI & Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

This repository contains my practical implementation of Supervised Learning algorithms (Regression & Classification), achieving high accuracy on real-world datasets.

## 🛠️ Projects Overview

### 1. 🚗 Vehicle Price Prediction (Regression)
- **Goal:** Predict used car selling prices.
- **Key Challenge:** Handling dirty data (strings mixed with numbers) and non-linear relationships.
- **Solution:** - Used **RegEx** for feature extraction.
  - Implemented **Random Forest Regressor**.
- **Result:** Accuracy improved from baseline to **97.5% ($R^2$ Score)**.

### 2. 📱 Mobile Price Classification (Classification)
- **Goal:** Classify mobile phones into 4 price categories.
- **Key Challenge:** Features with different scales (RAM vs Battery).
- **Solution:** - Applied **StandardScaler** for normalization.
  - Used **OneVsOne Logistic Regression**.
- **Result:** Achieved **97.7% Accuracy**.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Modeling, Preprocessing, Metrics)
- **Matplotlib** (Visualization)
