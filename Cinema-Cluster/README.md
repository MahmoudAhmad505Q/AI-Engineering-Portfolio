🎬 Cinema-Cluster: Unsupervised Movie CategorizationLeveraging KMeans & GMM for Advanced Content Clustering📌 Project OverviewThis project aims to automatically categorize Netflix's vast library of movies and TV shows using Unsupervised Machine Learning. By analyzing textual metadata (descriptions, cast, and genres), the model identifies hidden thematic patterns without the need for manual labeling.The core of this project is a comparative study between Hard Clustering (KMeans) and Soft Clustering (Gaussian Mixture Models - GMM), demonstrating how probabilistic models can better capture the "hybrid" nature of modern cinema.🚀 Key FeaturesFeature Engineering: Combined description, cast, and listed_in to create a rich contextual feature set.Text Vectorization: Utilized TF-IDF with 1,000 max features to convert text into numerical vectors.Dimensionality Reduction: Implemented TruncatedSVD (100 components) to handle sparse matrices and PCA for 2D visualization.Model Evaluation: Used the Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and Davies-Bouldin Index to determine the optimal number of clusters ($k=3$).Soft Clustering Analysis: Leveraged GMM to identify movies that fall into "boundary areas" between genres.📊 Clustering Results & InterpretationBased on the analysis, the Netflix library was successfully partitioned into three distinct thematic pillars:Cluster IDThemeTop GenresCluster 0Global CinemaInternational Movies, Dramas, Independent MoviesCluster 1Family & RealityChildren & Family, Documentaries, ComediesCluster 2Performance ArtStand-Up Comedy, Talk Shows, MusicalsKMeans vs. GMM: The "Soft Clustering" EdgeOne of the highlights of this project is the comparison on ambiguous descriptions.Example Input: "A story about a man and a car in a city."KMeans: Assigned strictly to Cluster 2.GMM: Revealed a 51%/49% probability split between Cluster 1 and Cluster 2, accurately reflecting the thematic ambiguity of the text.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: PythonLibraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, matplotlibEnvironment: Developed on WSL 2 (Ubuntu 24.04) using an HP Victus 15.
